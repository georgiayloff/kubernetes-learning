Pod definition:
        The simplest pod definition describes the deployment of a single container.
Example:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.7.9
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80

A pod definition is a declaration of a desired state. Desired state is a very important concept in the Kubernetes model. Many things present a desired state to the system, and it is Kubernetesâ€™ responsibility to make sure that the current state matches the desired state.
